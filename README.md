This is a SQL data analysis project.

In this project our stakeholder is a aspiring web developer who needs data-driven insights to know what type of app to build.

In this project we found a few insights: 

1. Paid Apps have better ratings.

Our data analysis has shown that paid apps generally achieve slightly higher ratings than the 
free counterparts so this could be due to a number of reasons, users who pay for an app
may have higher engagement and perceive more value leading to a better ratings. 

2. Apps supporting between 10 and 30 languages have better ratings.

Interestingly our analysis has found that apps supporting a number of languages between
10 and 30 had the highest average rating so we can conclude that it's not just about the quantity of languages
that app can suport, it's more about focus on the right languages to focus.

3. Finance and Books apps have low ratings. 

In our data analysis we have found that there is certain categories that have low users ratings,
and this may suggest that the user needs are not being fully met and this can represent a market opportunity 
because if we can create a good quality app in these categories that adresses user needs better then the current offer, 
there is potential for high user ratings and market penetration. Then we checked the app description 
length and we can conclude that the app description length has a positive correlation with the user ratings 
so the user likely appreciate having a clear understanding of the apps features and capabilities before they 
download the app. So detail well-crafted app description can set clear expectation and eventually increase 
the satisfaction of users. 
We also  seen the target rating in average all the apps have a rating of 3.5, in order to stand out from the crowd 
we should aim for a rating that is higher than the average that is 3.5.
Lastly the games and entertainment category have a very high volume of apps, suggesting that the market 
may be saturated, so entering in these spaces might be challenging due to the high competition however it also 
suggest a high user demand in this sectors.
